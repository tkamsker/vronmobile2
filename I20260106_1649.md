 ✅ VRon Logo Successfully Implemented!

  What Was Done:

  1. Login Screen Branding 🎨

  - Replaced the text placeholder "VRON" with the actual logo image
  - Logo displays at 200x100px with proper scaling (fit: contain)
  - Centered on the login screen for optimal visibility

  2. iOS App Icons 📱

  - Generated all required iOS icon sizes (20x20 to 1024x1024)
  - Updated AppIcon.appiconset with VRon branding
  - Alpha channel removed for iOS compatibility

  3. Android App Icons 🤖

  - Generated launcher icons for all densities (mdpi to xxxhdpi)
  - Created adaptive icons with white background (#FFFFFF)
  - Added foreground/background layers for modern Android

  4. Project Assets 📂

  - Logo stored in: assets/images/vron_logo.png
  - Configured in pubspec.yaml for access
  - Added flutter_launcher_icons for automated icon generation

  Files Changed:

  - 52 files updated across iOS, Android, and Flutter code
  - Login screen: lib/features/auth/screens/main_screen.dart
  - iOS icons: All sizes in ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
