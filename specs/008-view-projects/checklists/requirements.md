# Specification Quality Checklist: Complete Project Management Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**:
- ✅ All content quality items pass
- ✅ All requirement completeness items pass
- ✅ All feature readiness items pass
- ✅ Specification is clear, testable, and ready for planning

**Key Strengths**:
- Builds on existing implementation (70% already done)
- Clear prioritization (P1 for MVP create project feature)
- Measurable success criteria (timing, performance)
- Well-defined edge cases and validation rules
- Technology-agnostic requirements

**Context**:
This specification completes an existing feature by filling identified gaps from codebase analysis. The core project viewing functionality is already implemented and tested.
