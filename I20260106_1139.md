 ✅ All Documentation Updated!

  I've completely rewritten all three documentation files to match your actual SDK-based implementation:

  Files Corrected (3 commits):

  1. spec.md - Feature specification
    - Changed from redirect-based to SDK-based flow
    - Updated all acceptance scenarios, requirements, and technical flow
    - Fixed edge cases and success criteria
  2. plan.md - Implementation plan
    - Updated dependencies (google_sign_in not url_launcher)
    - Changed platform config (SDK setup not deep links)
    - Fixed performance goals and constraints
  3. tasks.md - Task breakdown (67 tasks)
    - Rewrote all 6 phases for SDK approach
    - Marked completed tasks (T001-T028, T030-T045, T050-T052, T054, T060-T062, T064)
    - Removed all references to redirect/deep link handling

  Documentation Now Accurately Reflects:

  Actual Working Flow:
  1. User taps "Sign in with Google"
  2. google_sign_in SDK initializes
  3. SDK displays Google consent screen
  4. User authenticates with Google
  5. SDK returns GoogleSignInAccount with idToken
  6. App sends idToken to signInWithGoogle GraphQL mutation
  7. Backend validates idToken with Google
  8. Backend returns access token + user data
  9. App stores token and navigates to home screen

  NOT using (what I incorrectly implemented):
  - ❌ URL redirects to backend
  - ❌ Deep link callbacks
  - ❌ exchangeMobileAuthCode mutation
  - ❌ app_links package

  Your existing signInWithGoogle() method at auth_service.dart:314-559 is the correct implementation and should work! The documentation now matches your code.

⏺ ✅ Documentation Fixes Pushed!

  Successfully pushed 3 commits to origin/003-google-oauth-login:

  Commits pushed:
  1. dfb1adf - docs: fix OAuth spec to match SDK-based implementation
  2. 0ea0c7c - docs: update plan.md to reflect SDK-based OAuth implementation
  3. f403992 - docs: rewrite tasks.md for SDK-based OAuth implementation

  Summary:
  - ✅ spec.md - Updated to SDK-based flow
  - ✅ plan.md - Updated dependencies and approach
  - ✅ tasks.md - Rewrote all 67 tasks for SDK implementation

  Remote branch updated: 003-google-oauth-login

  Your documentation now correctly describes the google_sign_in SDK approach that's actually implemented in your codebase. The incorrect redirect-based OAuth documentation has been completely replaced with accurate SDK-based flow documentation.
