 Perfect! I've disabled Android builds in the CI/CD pipeline and added clear markers for re-enabling them later. Here's what was done:

  ---
  ✅ Changes Made

  1. Disabled Android Builds in Pipeline

  File: .github/workflows/flutter-cicd.yml

  Disabled in build-stage job:
  - ❌ Build Android stage (AAB)
  - ❌ Upload Android stage artifact

  Disabled in build-main job:
  - ❌ Build Android prod (AAB)
  - ❌ Upload Android prod artifact

  2. Added Clear Markers

  Added prominent comment blocks around disabled sections:

  # ============================================================================
  # ANDROID BUILD - TEMPORARILY DISABLED
  # TODO: Re-enable when Android signing and build issues are resolved
  # Uncomment the steps below to restore Android builds
  # ============================================================================

  # # Android stage build (APK / AAB)
  # - name: Build Android stage (AAB)
  #   run: |
  #     flutter build appbundle \
  #       --flavor stage \
  #       --release \
  #       --dart-define=BUILD_NUMBER=${BUILD_NUMBER}

  # # Upload Android stage artifact
  # ...

  # ============================================================================
  # END ANDROID BUILD
  # ============================================================================

  🚀 What's Still Active

  The pipeline will now successfully complete with:

  - ✅ iOS stage builds → TestFlight (Internal Testing)
  - ✅ iOS prod builds → TestFlight (Closed Testing)
  - ✅ Flutter analyze (code quality checks)
  - ✅ Semantic release (versioning & tagging)

  Comprehensive guide including:

  Issues to Resolve:

  1. Android signing configuration (keystore, key.properties)

  3. CI/CD workflow signing step
  4. Product flavors verification

  Re-enablement Instructions:

  - Step 1: Locate disabled sections
  - Step 2: Uncomment build steps
  - Step 3: Add signing setup step
  - Step 4: Test locally first
  - Step 5: Commit and push
  - Step 6: Monitor CI/CD

  Testing Checklist:

  - Local build verification
  - CI/CD testing
  - Play Console testing

  🔄 How to Re-enable Later

  When Android signing is fixed:

  1. Find the sections:
  # Search for this in the workflow file:
  "ANDROID BUILD - TEMPORARILY DISABLED"

  2. Uncomment the lines:
  # Remove the # from these lines:
  # - name: Build Android stage (AAB)
  # - name: Upload Android stage artifact

  3. Add signing setup step:
  - name: Setup Android signing
    run: |
      echo "${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE }}" | base64 -d > android/upload-key.jks
      cat > android/key.properties <<EOF
      storePassword=${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}
      keyPassword=${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD }}
      keyAlias=${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS }}
      storeFile=upload-key.jks
      EOF

  4. Test locally, then push
