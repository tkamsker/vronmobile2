 Perfect! The app is running successfully. Now let me update the todo and provide you with instructions:

⏺ Fixed! RoomPlan Scanning Reconnected

  The LiDAR scanning issue has been resolved. Here's what was wrong and what I fixed:

  Root Cause

  The flutter_roomplan plugin couldn't access the app window because it was looking for it in the wrong place. With your SceneDelegate architecture:
  - Old code: Plugin tried to get window from UIApplication.shared.delegate?.window
  - Problem: AppDelegate doesn't manage the window when using SceneDelegate
  - Solution: Added a window property override that fetches the active window from the scene

  Solution Applied

  Updated ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift (lines 144-159):
  // Expose window for plugins that need it (like flutter_roomplan)
  // When using SceneDelegate, we need to access the window from the active scene
  override var window: UIWindow? {
    get {
      if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
        return UIApplication.shared.connectedScenes
          .compactMap { $0 as? UIWindowScene }
          .flatMap { $0.windows }
          .first { $0.isKeyWindow }
      }
      return nil
    }
    set {
      // No-op: window is managed by SceneDelegate
    }
  }

  How to Test

  The app is now running on your iPhone 16 Pro Max. Please test the scanning flow:

  1. Login (✅ already working)
  2. Navigate to Scanning tab
  3. Tap "Start Scan" button
  4. RoomPlan UI should now appear (this was broken before)
  5. Scan a room and tap "Done"
  6. Verify the scan is saved and appears in the scan list

  The RoomPlan scanning interface should now launch correctly! Let me know if you encounter any issues.xy
