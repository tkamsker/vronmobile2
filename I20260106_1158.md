The Swift linker error is completely fixed ✅ - the build succeeds every time now. The current issue is a macOS automation permission problem preventing Flutter from launching Xcode automatically.

  Here are your options to launch the app:

  Option 1: Open Xcode and run directly (Recommended)
  open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
  Then in Xcode: Select your device and press ⌘R to run

  Option 2: Fix automation permissions
  1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Automation
  2. Find Terminal (or VS Code if using that)
  3. Enable permission for Xcode

  Option 3: Try with release mode (sometimes works better)
  flutter run -d 00008140-0005185602DB001C --release

  Let me commit the iOS 15.0 deployment target fix since that resolved the original Swift error:

⏺ Bash(git add ios/Podfile && git commit -m "fix: update iOS deployment target to 15.0 for Swift concurrency support…)

        ac3763c..919bce9  003-google-oauth-login -> 003-google-oauth-login

⏺ Summary: iOS Build Fixed ✅

  Root Cause: Swift concurrency features require iOS 15.0+, but Podfile was set to iOS 13.0

  What Was Fixed:
  - ✅ Updated ios/Podfile platform from 13.0 to 15.0
  - ✅ Added deployment target enforcement for all pods
  - ✅ Cleaned and reinstalled pods
  - ✅ Xcode build now succeeds (no more _swift_coroFrameAlloc linker error)

  Current Status:
  - Build: ✅ SUCCESS (completes in ~8-23 seconds)
  - Launch: ⚠️ macOS automation permission issue (Flutter can't auto-launch Xcode)

  To Run Your App:

  Simply open Xcode and run from there:
  open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
  Then press ⌘R in Xcode to build and run on your device.

  Changes Committed & Pushed:
  ✅ Commit: 919bce9 "fix: update iOS deployment target to 15.0 for Swift concurrency support"
  ✅ Pushed to: origin/003-google-oauth-login

  The Swift linker error is completely resolved! 🎉
