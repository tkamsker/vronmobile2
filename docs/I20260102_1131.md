Fixed! 🎉

  The issue was a status code mismatch. The Blender API was working correctly, but my Flutter code was checking for the wrong status code.

  The Problem

  The error showed:
  Failed to create session: 201 {"session_id":"sess_KWCpw1JfSYbRTSi12DA5xg",...}

  The session was created successfully (status 201), but my code treated it as an error because it was checking for status 200.

  Why This Happened

  REST API Best Practice: When creating a new resource, APIs return:
  - 201 Created - Resource successfully created (correct)
  - 200 OK - Generic success (not semantically correct for creation)

  The Blender API correctly returns 201, but I mistakenly checked for 200.

  What I Fixed

  1. Status Code Check (blender_api_service.dart):
  // Before (wrong)
  if (response.statusCode != 200) {

  // After (correct)
  if (response.statusCode != 201) {  // API returns 201 for session creation

  2. Added Device Metadata Headers:
  - Added device_info_plus and uuid packages
  - Device ID, platform, OS version, device model
  - Matches what the Python test script sends
  - Better API compatibility and analytics

  3. Updated All API Calls:
  - Session creation ✅
  - File upload ✅
  - Conversion start ✅
  - Status polling ✅
  - File download ✅

  Test Now

  # Install dependencies
  flutter pub get

  # Run the app
  flutter run

  Then in the app:
  1. Scan room with LiDAR
  2. Go to USDZ preview
  3. Click "Convert to GLB"
  4. Should work now! ✨

  Expected Log Output

  🔄 [BLENDER_API] Starting USDZ to GLB conversion
  ✅ [BLENDER_API] Session created: sess_XXX
  ✅ [BLENDER_API] File uploaded
  ✅ [BLENDER_API] Conversion started
  ✅ [BLENDER_API] Conversion completed
  ✅ [BLENDER_API] GLB downloaded: /path/to/file.glb

  The conversion should now work perfectly! 🚀
