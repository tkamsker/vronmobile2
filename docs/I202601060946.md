  🚀 Next Steps

  Option 1: Ship It! 🚢

  The feature is production-ready. You can:
  1. Merge 018-combined-scan-navmesh → main
  2. Create release build
  3. Deploy to TestFlight/App Store

  Option 2: Add Analytics 📊

  If you want usage tracking:
  # T088: Add Firebase Analytics
  flutter pub add firebase_analytics
  # Then integrate events in CombinedScanService

  Option 3: Create PR 📝

  Ready to review:
  git push origin 018-combined-scan-navmesh
  # Then create PR with comprehensive test results

  💡 Recommendations

  1. Ship current version - It's fully functional and tested
  2. Monitor usage - Add T088 (analytics) in next iteration if needed
  3. Profile real-world usage - T097-T099 only if performance issues reported
  4. Unity example - T101 can be separate documentation project

  Congratulations! 🎊 You now have a production-ready multi-room LiDAR scanning workflow with automatic navmesh generation for Unity. The implementation is complete, tested, and documented.

  Would you like me to create a pull request or continue with any of the optional enhancements?
