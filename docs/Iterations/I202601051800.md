  🎯 Recommendations

  Next Steps (Priority Order):

  1. Run Flutter Tests to verify all implementations:
  flutter test test/features/scanning/
  2. Manual Testing on physical iOS device:
    - Test with 2-3 real LiDAR scans
    - Verify USDZ combination works
    - Test cancellation at each stage
    - Validate export functionality
  3. Optional Polish (if time permits):
    - T088: Add Firebase Analytics events
    - T095-T096: VoiceOver and Dynamic Type testing
    - T101: Create Unity import example

  The core workflow is feature-complete and ready for QA testing!
