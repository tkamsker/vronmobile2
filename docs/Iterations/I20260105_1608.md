Perfect! I've changed the "Ready to Save" button to "Delete Scan" with full deletion functionality:

  ✅ Changes Made (usdz_preview_screen.dart)

  1. Changed Button Appearance (lines 102-109)

  // BEFORE:
  TextButton(
    onPressed: () => _saveToProject(),
    child: const Text(
      'Ready to save',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.blue, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
    ),
  )

  // AFTER:
  TextButton.icon(
    onPressed: () => _deleteScan(),
    icon: const Icon(Icons.delete, color: Colors.red),
    label: const Text(
      'Delete Scan',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red, fontWeight: FontWeight.w600),
    ),
  )

  2. Implemented Delete Functionality (lines 807-918)

  Features:
  - ✅ Confirmation Dialog with warning icon
  - ✅ Shows what will be deleted:
    - • USDZ file (always)
    - • GLB file (if exists)
  - ✅ "This action cannot be undone" warning in red
  - ✅ Cancel and Delete buttons

  Deletion Process:
  1. Shows confirmation dialog
  2. If confirmed:
    - Deletes USDZ file from disk
    - Deletes GLB file if it exists
    - Removes scan from session manager
    - Shows success snackbar
    - Navigates back with {'action': 'delete'}
  3. If cancelled: Does nothing

  Error Handling:
  - Catches any deletion errors
  - Shows error snackbar with details
  - Logs all actions for debugging

  Expected User Flow:

  1. User opens USDZ Preview
  2. Sees red "Delete Scan" button in top-right
  3. Clicks button
  4. Sees confirmation dialog:
  ⚠️  Delete Scan?

  This will permanently delete:
  • USDZ file
  • GLB file (if converted)

  This action cannot be undone.

  [Cancel]  [Delete]
  5. If Delete clicked:
    - Files deleted
    - Returns to scan list
    - Scan removed from list

  The scan and all associated files are now completely removed! 🎉
