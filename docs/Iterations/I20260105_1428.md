✅ Changes Made

  1. "Create GLB" Button Now Active with 2+ Scans

  - Before: Required scans to have position data (from canvas arrangement)
  - After: Enabled as soon as 2 or more scans exist
  - Automatically assigns default grid positions if scans don't have positions yet

  2. "Generate NavMesh" Button Activates When GLB Exists

  - Enabled when _combinedScan.status == glbReady
  - This happens after the combined USDZ is uploaded and converted to GLB by the backend

  3. ADD Project Auto-Uses Combined GLB Files (scan_list_screen.dart:479-498)

  - When you click "ADD Project", it automatically checks for completed combined scan
  - If available, it pre-populates:
    - World File: Combined GLB (combinedGlbLocalPath)
    - Mesh File: NavMesh GLB (localNavmeshPath)
  - Shows green success banner: "Using combined GLB and NavMesh from your scans"
  - Each file shows a green checkmark indicator
  - Users can still change files if needed by clicking the file pickers

  4. Simplified Position Handling (scan_list_screen.dart:1562-1575)

  - Scans without positions get default grid layout automatically
  - 3-column grid: positionX = (index % 3) * 100, positionY = (index / 3) * 100
  - Removes the error about needing position data
