✅ Issue 1: GraphQL Query Error - FIXED

  Problem: GraphQL mutation was requesting worldId field that doesn't exist in backend response

  Root Cause: Backend's VRonCreateProjectFromOwnWorldResponse only returns projectId (line 115 of test script)

  Fixed in: lib/features/home/services/byo_project_service.dart

  Changes:
  1. Removed worldId from GraphQL query (line 56)
  // BEFORE:
  VRonCreateProjectFromOwnWorld(input: $input) {
    projectId
    worldId  // ❌ Field doesn't exist
  }

  // AFTER:
  VRonCreateProjectFromOwnWorld(input: $input) {
    projectId  // ✅ Only field that exists
  }
  2. Removed worldId extraction (line 165)
  // BEFORE:
  final worldId = result['worldId'] as String?;

  // AFTER:
  worldId: null, // Backend doesn't return worldId
  3. Added explanatory comment about backend limitation

  Now matches test_create_byo_project_combined.sh exactly!

  ✅ Issue 2: Missing Translation - FIXED

  Problem: Translation key home.filterBYO missing in German and Portuguese

  Fixed in:
  - lib/core/i18n/de.json (line 8) - Added "filterBYO": "BYO"
  - lib/core/i18n/pt.json (line 8) - Added "filterBYO": "BYO"

  Context: English translation already existed, but German and Portuguese were missing the key, causing fallback warnings when app language switched.

  📊 Expected Results:

  Before:
  ❌ Cannot query field "worldId" on type "VRonCreateProjectFromOwnWorldResponse"
  ⚠️ Translation not found for key: home.filterBYO

  After:
  ✅ Project created successfully
  ✅ Project ID: <id>
  ✅ No translation warnings

  The BYO project creation should now work correctly, and the filter dropdown will display properly in all languages! 🎉
