✅ Changes Made (scan_list_screen.dart:1597-1629)

  Added GLB Conversion After USDZ Combination

  Complete workflow now:
  1. ✅ Combine scans into one USDZ
  2. ✅ Upload USDZ to BlenderAPI (status: uploadingUsdz)
  3. ✅ Convert to GLB (status: processingGlb)
  4. ✅ Download GLB (status: glbReady)
  5. ✅ Ready for NavMesh generation!

  Key additions:
  // After creating combined USDZ...
  final glbPath = await _blenderApiService.convertUsdzToGlb(
    usdzPath: combinedScan.localCombinedPath,
    onProgress: (progress, statusText) {
      // Real-time progress updates
      // Status switches from uploadingUsdz → processingGlb
    },
  );

  Status Tracking

  - Shows "Uploading to server..." during upload (progress 0-50%)
  - Shows "Creating Combined GLB" during conversion (progress 50-100%)
  - Progress dialog updates in real-time
  - "Generate NavMesh" button activates when status is glbReady
