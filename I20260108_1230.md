Excellent! All fixes have been pushed to stage. Here's what was fixed based on the CI/CD log analysis:

  ✅ Issues Fixed

  1. Missing iOS Gemfile

  Problem: CI/CD failed with:
  Could not locate Gemfile
  ##[error]Process completed with exit code 10.

  Solution: Created ios/Gemfile with fastlane dependency:
  gem "fastlane", "~> 2.220"

  2. Wrong Android AAB Artifact Path

  Problem: The build succeeded but artifact upload failed:
  ✓ Built build/app/outputs/bundle/stageRelease/app-stage-release.aab (46.6MB)
  ##[warning]No files were found with the provided path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/*.aab

  Solution: Updated workflow to use correct paths:
  - Stage: build/app/outputs/bundle/stageRelease/*.aab
  - Prod: build/app/outputs/bundle/prodRelease/*.aab
  - Split env vars: ANDROID_APK_BUILD_DIR and ANDROID_AAB_BUILD_DIR

  3. Missing fastlane Configuration

  Problem: CI/CD workflow expects fastlane lanes but no configuration existed

  Solution: Created complete fastlane setup:
  - ios/fastlane/Fastfile: Defines build_upload_testflight lane with:
    - App Store Connect API integration
    - Match code signing
    - Build number management
    - TestFlight upload
    - Support for stage/prod flavors
  - ios/fastlane/Appfile: Team ID and Apple ID configuration
