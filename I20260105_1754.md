  🚀 Implementation Scope Decision

  This feature has 101 tasks spanning:
  - Foundation & Setup: 11 tasks
  - TDD Tests: 16 tasks
  - Core Implementation: 59 tasks
  - Polish & Integration: 15 tasks

  Estimated total implementation time: ~46 hours (28-32 calendar hours with parallel execution)

  I can proceed in two ways:

  1. Full Automated Implementation (All 101 tasks)
    - Complete end-to-end implementation following TDD
    - Will take significant time and multiple iterations
    - Recommended for greenfield implementation
  2. Phase-by-Phase with Checkpoints (Recommended)
    - Phase 1 & 2: Setup + Foundation (11 tasks)
    - Checkpoint: Review models and structure
    - Phase 3a: Tests (16 tasks)
    - Phase 3b: Implementation (59 tasks)
    - Phase 4: Polish (15 tasks)

  Which approach would you like?
  - Type "full" for complete automated implementation
  - Type "phase" for phase-by-phase with checkpoints
  - Type "foundation" to start with just Phase 1 & 2 (recommended first step)
