  ✅ Comprehensive Scan Deletion Implemented

  Changes Made:

  1. UsdzPreviewScreen - Enhanced Deletion

  Now deletes all files associated with a scan:
  - ✅ USDZ file - Original scan file
  - ✅ GLB file - Converted file (if exists)
  - ✅ NavMesh file - Navigation mesh (if created at scans/navmesh/{scanId}_navmesh.glb)

  2. Improved Tracking & Logging

  - Added file deletion counter
  - Detailed logging with emoji indicators (✅, ⚠️, ℹ️)
  - Tracks success/failure for each file deletion
  - Reports total files deleted

  3. Session Manager Enhancement

  Modified ScanSessionManager.removeScan() to:
  - Return bool indicating if scan was found and removed
  - Better logging when scan is not found in array
  - Validates removal was successful

  4. Updated Confirmation Dialog

  Now clearly shows what will be deleted:
  This will permanently delete all files associated with this scan:
  • USDZ scan file
  • GLB converted file (if exists)
  • NavMesh file (if created)

  The scan will also be removed from the session.

  This action cannot be undone.

  Deletion Flow:

  1. Confirm - User confirms deletion via dialog
  2. Delete USDZ - Original scan file
  3. Delete GLB - Converted file (if exists)
  4. Delete NavMesh - Navigation mesh file (if created)
  5. Remove from Array - Remove from session manager
  6. Report - Log total files deleted and success status

  All changes have been committed and pushed to the stage branch!
