 ✅ Completed Changes

  1. Dynamic Button Text & Icon (scan_list_screen.dart:160-189)

  - Button now shows "UPDATE Project" with edit icon when a project is selected
  - Shows "ADD Project" with add icon when no project is selected
  - Provides clear visual feedback about the action being performed

  2. Intelligent File Detection (scan_list_screen.dart:481-553)

  - Priority 1: Combined scan files (if completed)
    - Uses _combinedScan.combinedGlbLocalPath for GLB
    - Uses _combinedScan.localNavmeshPath for navmesh
  - Priority 2: Single scan files
    - Checks scan.glbLocalPath for GLB files
    - Checks Documents/scans/navmesh/<scan_id>_navmesh.glb for navmesh files
  - Stops searching once both files are found

  3. Comprehensive Logging

  - Added emoji indicators for easy log scanning:
    - 🔍 for checking/searching
    - ✅ for success/found
    - ⚠️ for warnings
    - ℹ️ for info messages
  - Logs show exactly which files are detected and used

  4. Dialog Auto-population

  - When files are found, dialog shows green success message: "Using combined GLB and NavMesh from your scans. You can change files if needed."
  - File pickers display detected filenames automatically
  - Users can still manually change files if needed

  🧪 Testing

  The app is currently installing on your device. Once launched, you can test by:

  1. Navigate to a project with scans
  2. Check button text:
    - Should show "ADD Project" initially
    - Select a project → should change to "UPDATE Project"
  3. Click the button → Dialog should open
  4. Check logs in console for file detection messages
  5. Verify auto-population:
    - If GLB and navmesh exist, both fields should be pre-filled
    - Green success message should appear at top
    - File badges should show "Using combined GLB from scans" etc.

  The implementation is complete and committed. The files will be auto-detected and populated whenever users open the project dialog!
