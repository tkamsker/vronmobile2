 Excellent! I've successfully completed the core implementation of Phase 3 (User Story 1 - MVP). Let me provide a progress summary:

  ✅ Phase 3 Implementation Complete

  I've successfully implemented the redirect-based OAuth flow (T018-T028):

  What was completed:

  Core OAuth Service (auth_service.dart:565-719)
  - initiateGoogleOAuth() - Constructs OAuth URL and launches in browser
  - handleOAuthCallback() - Processes deep link with authorization code/error
  - _exchangeMobileAuthCode() - Exchanges auth code for access token via GraphQL
  - Token storage and GraphQL client refresh integrated

  Deep Link Handling (main_screen.dart:31-119)
  - Added app_links package for deep link listening
  - _initDeepLinks() - Sets up deep link subscription
  - _handleDeepLink() - Routes OAuth callbacks to AuthService
  - Updated _handleGoogleSignIn() to use new redirect flow
  - Navigation to home screen on successful authentication

  Files modified:
  - lib/features/auth/services/auth_service.dart - Added 3 new methods (155 lines)
  - lib/features/auth/screens/main_screen.dart - Added deep link handling (91 lines)
  - pubspec.yaml - Added app_links ^6.3.4 dependency
  - specs/003-google-oauth-login/tasks.md - Marked T018-T028 complete

  Progress Summary:

  - Phase 1: 6/6 tasks ✅ Complete
  - Phase 2: 3/3 tasks ✅ Complete
  - Phase 3: 11/20 tasks ✅ (Implementation complete, tests pending)
    - T010-T017: 8 unit/integration tests need to be written (TDD)
    - T029: Test verification pending

  Total Progress: 20/67 tasks complete (30%)

  OAuth Flow Implementation:

  1. User taps "Sign in with Google" → initiateGoogleOAuth()
  2. App launches browser with OAuth URL → Backend handles Google OAuth
  3. Backend redirects back to app → vronapp://oauth-callback?code=AUTH_CODE
  4. Deep link listener triggers → _handleDeepLink()
  5. AuthService processes callback → handleOAuthCallback()
  6. Code exchanged for token → _exchangeMobileAuthCode()
  7. Token stored, GraphQL refreshed → Navigate to home screen

  The MVP OAuth flow is now functionally complete and ready for testing!

  Todos
